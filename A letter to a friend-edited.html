<p>Dear Sam,</p>

<p>I had been meaning to write to you for quite some time.
        <!-- But every time I stared at the empty page I grew nauseous. I still have that nervous stomach.-->
    I apologize for the delay. 
    Work has been busy, and I’ve been taking some remedial classes on the side 
    to bring up my marks in time for spring applications.
        <!--To make up for the months I spent stagnant. Ha ha.--> </p>

<p>The weather has been changing for the better, I’ve noticed. 
    These days, the thick snow is just scattered slush, 
    and my winter gear feels too tight and over-warm. 
    You know how much I hate being cold, so it's a welcome change.  </p> 

<p>Do you remember when we walked the long way home from the theatre so you could see the first snowfall? 
    I was so cold my chest was rattling, but you seemed to enjoy yourself. </p>
         <!--Seemed so, but I don’t know how much attention I was paying you. Not enough, certainly.--->

<script>
if (you cared) {
    I would tell you that I have spent my days sad since you left, 
    your ego would probably appreciate that, but it's not even true. 
    What I feel is a whole lot of nothing. 
    You always told me I was cold, but even you wouldn’t recognize me now.
  } 
  else {disregard="It's alright";

if (I had the luxury of honesty) {
    I’d tell you I'm tired. It tires me, the rapid excavation of my priorities. 
    Every day I peel them off their warm holdings and rearrange them around things that are not you. 
    Sometimes they don't stick, because my indifference is cool and slate grey
    ––so different from the tacky red finish I was coated in just a year ago.
}
else {lying,lying="I'm over it";

</script>

<p>I stay off social media these days, and have been trying to do more things with my hands. 
    Writing, reading, even pottery, ha. 
    I didn’t have much time for those things before, so it’s been nice to get back to them.</p>
   
        <!--Did you know? Did you know that I was barely my own person with you around? I didn’t.-->

<p>I’d love to know what you’re up to these days, I can only imagine the fun you’re having.</p>

        <!--I imagine it so well that my eyes lose focus, 
        the life bleeding out of them faster than my sister can plaster on her bandage platitudes. 
        Even still, my curiosity is as endless as it is terrible.-->

<p>Do you still save time to go bike riding in the mornings?
        <!--Do you still bite your nails?-->
    Has your caffeine addiction gotten worse? </p>
        <!--Do you still collect people like accessories?-->

<p>I hope to hear from you soon. </p>
        <!--Don't repond, please-->

<p>I miss you.</p> 
        <!--And I’m sick with it.-->

<br>

<p>Your <!--wretched, constant--> friend,</p>
<p>Leah</p>
